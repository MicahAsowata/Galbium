# Galbius - to-do app of the future
It was created to practice what I have learnt in the Let's Go book by Alex Edwards sprinkled with some third party packages to handle some core stuff.

## Packages that I used so far
1. alexedwards/flow - routing
2. alexedwards/scs - session management
3. go-chi/chi/middleware - middleware 
4. uber-go/zap - logging
5. flosch/pongo2 - templating
6. albrow/forms - form parsing and validation

## What can Galbius do currently
1. CRUD tasks
2. Tasks are connected to their respective creator
3. User authentication and authorization
4. Password reset

## What needs to be done
1. Add a certificate for security
2. Use the request context
3. Use the embed package
4. Serve CSS and JS
5. Testing
